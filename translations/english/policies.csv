#,NobleTaxBreaks,Noble Tax Breaks,"The work of a noble can be a hard job. Estates to manage, countless paperwork to fill, and other burdens of being an aristocrat. We should make the tax code reflect that and reduce the tax burden of the nobility. Doing so will also gain us their support.  "

#,CentralBankingGuild,Central Banking Guild,"Instead of relying on a state-run central bank, we could give at least partial control over monetary policy and the commercial banking system to a guild of skilled merchants and bankers.

However, there are concerns that such a guild could become corrupt and self-serving without supervision."
#,PrivateCentralBank,Private Central Bank,"Instead of relying on a state-run central bank, we could give at least partial control over monetary policy and the commercial banking system to a trust elected by the biggest commercial banks in the country.

The regime, known for its infamous antisemitic laws, was ruling the Rhineland until 1978 when partially democratic elections were held. Currently, there is a strong movement for reunification with Communist Germany, but the cost of leaving a strategically and economically important region of the Rhine to them might be a mistake."
#,FrenchAlgeria,French Algeria,"Between XIX and XX centuries, we started to conquer the North African lands known as Algeria. Despite our efforts to assimilate the natives, Algeria remains to this day mostly Muslim. Rich in natural resources but poorly developed, the public opinion is split if we should invest more in trying to keep these lands in our realm, or simply let the Algerians rule themselves."

We could also lessen our dependence on oil and gas imported from the West by securing imports of Russian oil."
